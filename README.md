# DepiTetrs
built from a basic game from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAUn1Lom6dw

# How to Play:
Tetris but the player only scores points if the rows they clear contain less than 4 colors.


Clearing a row with 3 colors: 10 points


Clearing a row with 2 colors: 30 points


Clearing a row with 1 color: 50 points


The pieces don't follow 7-bag order so it should be a bit easier. More stuff to come!
